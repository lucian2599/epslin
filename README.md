# epslin
EpsLin is a command line tool to access Ensoniq (EPS/ASR) formatted floppy disks, CD-ROMs, hard disks and disk images.

I have only attached Ensoniq_EFE2HFEv2.zip .
- Add support for up to 5MB floppy images for Ensoniq ASR12.
- Tested successfully with HxC floppy emulator.
- This is an old fork of epslin (from 2006), not merged with the latest changes in original epslin.
